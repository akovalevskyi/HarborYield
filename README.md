HarborYield - it's a platform where everyone can create balanvced and diversified RWA portfolio of tokenized stable and yield generating assets

HarborYield is a DeFi portfolio platform that makes real-world asset (RWA) investing simple, safe, and strategy-driven. Instead of forcing users to pick individual tokens, HarborYield helps anyone build a diversified portfolio across five tokenized asset categories: Funds, Real Estate, Private Credit, Commodities, and Equities—focused on stable value and sustainable yield.

Users select a risk profile (Defensive, Conservative, Balanced, Growth, Aggressive) and immediately see a target allocation based on best practices from mutual and hedge fund portfolio construction. The app compares the user’s current holdings vs. the target model and generates a clear Portfolio Health Score that reflects allocation drift, concentration, and overall diversification. With one click, users can rebalance back toward their chosen strategy, making professional-grade portfolio discipline accessible to retail investors.

HarborYield also surfaces real yield in a straightforward way: users can track income earned and claim available payouts directly from their portfolio dashboard. The result is an easy-to-understand, non-volatile DeFi experience that brings institutional-style asset allocation, risk awareness, and transparent on-chain yield to tokenized RWAs.
